# Data Science Portfolio
 
This repository consists of projects that use data science/statistical modeling to derive insights into data and generate predictions. 
 
## Projects:

###  Nonlinear Temperature Distributions [[R package](https://github.com/johnwoodill/nonlineartempr)] [[Python Package](https://github.com/johnwoodill/nonlineartemppy)]

* Calcuate nonlinear temperature distributions degree days and time in each degree.

* Measure accounts for the rise and fall of temperatures during the day.

* Degree days define time above a specified temperature threshold (e.g. degree days above 30C) and time in each degree define time within a specified temperature threshold (e.g. time in 30C).

* **Keywords**(R, Python, Economics, Climate Change, Agronomy)

 
###  [Business Case: Wine Quality and Price](https://github.com/alexhuang1117/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Bitcoin_Analysis/Bitcoin_Analysis.md)
* Predict wine quality based on biophysical characteristics.
* Model using Multinomial logit, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Random Forest, and Extreme Gradient Boosting

* **Keywords**(R, Classification, Economics)
