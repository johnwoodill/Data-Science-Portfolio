# Data Science Portfolio
 
This repository consists of projects that use data science/statistical modeling to derive insights into data and generate predictions. 
 
## Projects:

###  [Fine Scale Weather Data from 1900-2013](https://github.com/johnwoodill/Fine-Scale-Weather-Interpolation)

* Builds daily gridded weather data for the continental United States from 1900-2013.

* Relative anomaly spline interpolation technique calculates daily weather data for 460,000 2.5km x 2.5km grids in the US.

* Aggregates down to county level weather

* **Keywords**(R, Economics, Climate Change, Weather)

###  Nonlinear Temperature Distributions [[R package](https://github.com/johnwoodill/nonlineartempr)] [[Python Package](https://github.com/johnwoodill/nonlineartemppy)]

* Calcuate nonlinear temperature distributions degree days and time in each degree.

* Measure accounts for the rise and fall of temperatures during the day.

* Degree days define time above a specified temperature threshold (e.g. degree days above 30C) and time in each degree define time within a specified temperature threshold (e.g. time in 30C).

* **Keywords**(R, Python, Economics, Climate Change, Agronomy)

###  [Business Case: Wine Quality and Price](https://www.kaggle.com/johnwoodill/business-case-predicting-quality-wine-and-prices/notebook)

* Predict wine quality based on biophysical characteristics.

* Model using Multinomial logit, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Random Forest, and Extreme Gradient Boosting


* **Keywords**(R, Classification, Economics)
